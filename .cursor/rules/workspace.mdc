- use `bun install` to install dependencies
- use `bunx` to run commands (for example `bunx playwright install chromium`)
- always use `moon run :lint :types --affected` to verify changes you made
- if needed, use moon mcp server to help you
- use `moon <project>:<task>` to run tasks in the workspace (for example `moon blog-fe:dev` or for e2e tests `moon blog-fe:e2e`)
